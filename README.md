### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Choose Your Installation Method**
   - You can install grimaur directly from the Arch User Repository (AUR) or from a git mirror.

2. **Installation from the AUR**
   To install grimaur directly from the AUR, follow these steps:
   ```bash
   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/grimaur-git.git
   cd grimaur-git
   makepkg -si
   ```

3. **Installation from the Git Mirror**
   If the AUR is down, you can install from the git mirror:
   ```bash
   git clone --branch grimaur-git --single-branch https://github.com/archlinux/aur.git grimaur-git
   cd grimaur-git
   makepkg -si
   ```

4. **Complete the Installation**
   After running the commands, the system may prompt you for confirmation. Follow the prompts to finish the installation.

## üîç Searching for Packages

With grimaur, searching for packages is straightforward. Use the following command to find what you need:

- `grimaur <term>` (or `grimaur search <term>`)
  
This command lists packages that match your search term. You can then select the package you want to install.

## üì¶ Installing Packages

Once you find a package you want, installing it is easy. Use the command below to get started:

- `grimaur install <package>`

This command does several things for you:
1. It clones the package repository.
2. It checks for any needed dependencies.
3. It builds the package using `makepkg`.
4. It installs the software using `pacman`.

If you want to skip confirmation prompts during the installation, simply add the option:

- `--noconfirm`

This option will streamline the process, especially if you are installing multiple packages at once.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### AUR Not Responding

If the AUR is down, you can bypass the regular RPC commands by using the `--git-mirror` flag. Use your commands like this:

- `grimaur <package> --git-mirror`

This will allow you to continue working even when the AUR is unavailable.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements

To run grimaur, ensure you have the following:

- A working installation of Arch Linux or an Arch-based distribution.
- Git installed on your system.

Make sure your system is updated. You can update your Arch system with:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

## üìù Usage Examples

### Search for a Package

To search for a package, simply type:

```bash
grimaur search firefox
```

This will show you various versions of Firefox available for installation.

### Install a Package

To install a package, use:

```bash
grimaur install firefox
```
